Anemo is a file utility application that provides private local storage, but instead of being a
stand-alone file manager user interface, it hooks into various components of Android making
it feel like a native part of the operative system.
It also includes a simple text editor for editing text files on the device.
Moreover it provides ways for the user to export contents from other apps and save them as files.

## Features

- Private file storage available in the default Files application (the _DocumentsProviderUI_)
- Text editor
  - Open, edit and create text files
  - Cursor and selection information
  - Undo actions
  - Automatically close brackets and quotes: `'`, `"`, `(`, `[`, `{`
  - Commands
    - `/my text`: find next occurrence of _my text_ from the current cursor position
    - `d/my text`: delete all occurrences of _my text_
    - `N d/my text`: delete first N occurrences of _my text_ (write the number instead of N)
    - `s/my text/new text`: substitute all occurrences of _my text_ with _new text_
    - `N s/my text/new text`: substitute first N occurrences of _my text_ with _new text_
      (write the number instead of N)
    - `set/key/value`: set config option `key` to `value`
        - `commands` [`on` | `off`] : Change commands field visibility
