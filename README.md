Anemo is an utility application made of two components: a private local storage, and a text editor.
Instead of being a stand-alone file manager user interface, it hooks into various components of
Android making it feel like a native part of the operative system.
Moreover it provides ways for the user to export contents from other apps and save them as files.
The text editor can read and edit and create text files from the device or other apps.
