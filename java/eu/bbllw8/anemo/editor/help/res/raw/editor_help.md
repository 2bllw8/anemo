# Commands

## Find

To run the **find** command, type `/text to search` (replacing _text to search_
with whatever you want to find). The search is performed from the current cursor
position. It is also possible to search by regular expressions.


## Delete

To delete all occurrences of a certain string, type `d/text to delete` (replacing
_text to delete_ with whatever you want to delete).

>"A quick fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick fox is brown"
Running `d/quick`, assuming the cursor is at the beginning of the line, transforms the text to

>"A fox jumps over the lazy dog. The fox is brown"


### First occurrences

To delete a number of occurrences of a certain string (from the current cursor position),
type `N d/text to delete` (replacing _N_ with the number of occurrences to be deleted and
_text to delete_ with whatever you want to delete).

Run `1 d/quick` assuming the cursor is at the beginning of the line, transforms the text to

current cursor position), type `N s/text to delete/replacement text` (replacing _N_ with the
number of occurrences to be substituted and _text to delete_ with whatever you want to find
and _replacement text_ with whatever you want to replace the deleted text with).
